# Hi, I’m Riley Babson, @babsonr1

### I currently attend the University of Arizona, aquiring a MS in Business Analytics.
### I graduated from the University of Denver, double majoring in Biology and Mathematics.
### Also, I have completed a Data Analytics and Science Boot Camp in an effort to give me some more knowledge about databases and front-end graphics.

### My GitHub right now is just my projects from various classes, but I hope to expand that soon.
