# Hi, I’m Riley Babson, @babsonr1
### I am currently taking a Data Analytics and Science Boot Camp in an effort to give me some more knowledge about databases and front-end graphics.
### I go to school at the University of Denver, majoring in Biology and Mathematics.

### My GitHub right now is just my projects from the class, but I hope to expand that soon.
